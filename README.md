ZefyrGB - A Gameboy Emulator written in C
By: Paul Warwick

This began as a personal interest project of mine on 2/1/2025.
After struggling with my passion for software due to the current market outlook,
I thought back to my early days where I was impressed by systems such
as the GameBoy. Those consoles pre-2k and in the early 2000's were engineered
with great constraints and care in ways we don't quite see in today's abundant world.
There is something elegant about being so close to the machine while programming. 
The thought to recreate a system I loved not only has shown to be a daunting
task (writing this part on my first day of documentation diving), but also seems like
it would be much more rewarding than most software design tasks I've dealt with in my
past.
